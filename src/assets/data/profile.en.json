    "aboutMe": "Ever since I had my first Nintendo as a kid, I knew technology was my path. That passion led me to study Computer Engineering at INACAP, where I not only excelled academically but also organized events as a Microsoft Student Partner. I began my career at Stericycle, an international company in biohazard waste management headquartered in Chile, where I was part of the development team working as a QA Tester for projects in India. Later, I joined the Chilean Army, helping build the core system for military personnel management—a key software that centralizes critical information such as ratings, sanctions, studies, and performance. I'm currently a Full‑stack Developer at ISAPRE Consalud, working in an agile, multidisciplinary, and self‑managed team. There, I’ve strengthened my skills in agile methodologies and software development across platforms and technologies. Beyond the technical side, I stand out for my interpersonal skills: I connect easily with people, communicate complex topics clearly, and always focus on solutions over problems. Always looking for new challenges and opportunities to keep growing."
